% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:

% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use

% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
Production lines normally present a verification step, which is responsible for warning about defective devices, which should not be sent for commercial use. That step, in digital television (DTV) production lines, often includes a tuning and decoding check, which will basically verify if DTV devices are capable of presenting audio and video. However, poor signal conditions may cause unnecessary rejections, which happen due to very hostile environments. Because of that, the present paper proposes a verification methodology that reports poor signal conditions during tuning tests, with the goal of reporting that the associated check must be executed again. Tests in a real environment showed that the proposed approach is effective and efficient, while revealed that less than $40\%$ of the obtained rejections was really due to hardware problems.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
% no \IEEEPARstart

Production lines are commonly responsible for assembling commercial products, according to a predefined execution flow. In summary, components are added while a partially complete product moves through workstations, until a final assembly is obtained. Nonetheless, as the instantiations of a product manufacturing process, they normally provide some verification/testing step, which is in charge of warning about defective or nonconforming devices.

As widely known, production processes must be as accurate as possible, in order to provide a small rejection rate, which then reduces resources spent in problem correction or even financial losses, due to product return. In addition, a correct analysis depends on correct parameters and measures; otherwise, conforming products may be rejected (false negative) and also defective devices may be approved.

In production lines developed for digital TV (DTV) products \cite{keith}, such as terrestrial and satellite set-top boxes and integrated DTV receivers, the associated verification procedures often include a tuning and decoding step, which will confirm the primary device purpose. However, a correct result is only obtained if the provided signal can be decoded, {\it i.e.}, for example, the signal level is above the tuner sensitivity figure and the carrier-to-noise ratio is above the minimum acceptable limit, which depends on code rate, modulation type, and other parameters. In addition, such parameters must also be configured according to what is expected to be tested in the target device.%the transmission current environment, in order to overcome the communication channel difficulties, such as noise level and fading.

A common problem faced in DTV production lines is the device rejection caused by poor signal conditions, which may happen due to transmission infrastructure ({\it e.g.}, air or cable) and not hardware or software problems. At a first glance, that may seem overestimated; however, given that production lines are normally hostile environments, due to temperature, machine operation, and interference from other devices, such a verification becomes necessary.

The problems discussed in the last paragraphs are the inspiration for the present work, which proposes a simple verification methodology regarding product rejection, during tuning tests. In summary, the transmitted DTV signal is monitored, analyzed, according to standardized parameters and previously collected data, and, as a result, an automatic systems warns when a product is rejected, whenever poor signal conditions are identified. Execution results, in real environments, show that the proposed methodology is effective in providing a simple warning for a rejected product, during tuning tests, which is then confirmed under suitable signal conditions.

\section{Digital TV Signal Quality Parameters}\label{measure}
When a DTV signal is received and decoded, the most direct indication of reception problems is the presence of artifacts in the decoded video \cite{keith}. Those artifacts, in turn, are linked to the impossibility of acquisition of transport stream packets \cite{reimers,iso13818_1} without errors, due to the performance of error-correcting codes \cite{keith,reimers}. Traditional DTV standards, such as Digital Video Broadcasting \cite{dvb}, Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting (ISDB) \cite{isdb}, and Advanced Television Systems Committee \cite{atsc} normally employ a concatenated strategy, based on two encoders: an inner encoder, which is often based on convolutional codes, and an outer encoder, which normally relies on BCH codes, such as Reed-Solomon.

The mentioned strategy is able to provide quasi-error-free (QEF) reception after the Reed-Solomon decoder, when the bit error ratio (BER) after the convolutional decoder (viterbi algorithm) is below $2\times 10^{-4}$ \cite{dvb}. In addition, error visibility is considered to happen for BER values above $3\times 10^{-6}$ \cite{fcc}, after the Reed-Solomon decoder. It is worth noticing that such a performance is directly related to the signal input level (regarding sensitivity) and carrier-to-noise ratio (C/N).

In summary, one may infer about signal conditions by directly measuring BER values, after the inner and outer decoders, or radio frequency (RF) parameters, at system input. BER measurement could be done through the device itself, but that has the potential to mask other problems. A reference system could also perform that task, but, if not carefully chosen, it may also suffer from other issues. As a consequence, the measurement of RF input parameters, through certified equipment, presents itself as an interesting choice and is suitable for use in product line environments.

\section{The Proposed Methodology}\label{metho}
Given what was discussed in sections \ref{intro} and \ref{measure}, a complementary signal evaluation is necessary, during tuning tests, in order to indicate the repetition of verification processes, when poor signal conditions are detected. 

The proposed methodology is based on the measurement of two RF parameters, computed with the input signal: level and C/N. In summary, such parameters are obtained and used in a classification procedure, in order to warn about a possible verification error due to signal conditions. The following steps describe the final algorithm:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Receive an indication for starting a measurement;
	\item Acquire level and C/N;
	\item Classify according previous measurement data;
	\item Indicate signal conditions.
\end{itemize}

It is worth noticing that such a classification must be done according to standardized figures and previously measured data. Regarding that matter, one may notice that the standards themselves already suggest such values, according to the chosen configuration parameters. For instance, it is often assumed that when measuring the sensitivity of a receiver compliant with the Brazilian Digital Television System (BDTS), which uses the terrestrial ISDB as air interface, for a $64$-QAM modulation and $3/4$ code rate, QEF can be obtained if a minimum C/N of $19$ dB is set at system input \cite{sbtvd}. 

As a consequence, during the development of the present work, a great amount of tests was performed, in order to raise curves regarding signal level and C/N, along standardized values, for all handled transmission standards and configuration parameters, which were then used for signal quality classification. It is only necessary do indicate the current setup, {\it i.e.}, which standard and configuration is being used.

The proposed methodology can be easily integrated into any tuning verification procedure, in order to provide signal quality indications, as long as suitable equipment is employed. Besides, given that all steps can be performed automatically, there is no need for additional human interaction, which may result in financial savings.

\section{Test in a Real Environment}

The industrial pole of Manaus, in Brazil, has many industries specialized in the production of DTV equipment, and among them Technicolor Brazil was selected for integrating the proposed methodology, into the verification procedure of one of its production lines. The specific line was used for assembling set-top boxes, according to BDTS \cite{sbtvd}. The problem mentioned in section \ref{intro}, regarding verification failure due to signal conditions, was identified and handled, as described in section \ref{metho}. Figure \ref{figure:fig1} shows the employed system setup.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=3.4in]{Fig1.eps}}
\caption{System setup for real tests.}
\label{figure:fig1}
\end{figure}

As one can may notice, the tuning verification has an integrated signal condition evaluation and, if poor condition is detected, the proposed methodology indicates that another test must be performed. 

It is worth noticing that the proposed methodology was implemented through the spectrum analyzer PXIe-1073, produced by National Instruments, which was used as acquisition front-end. The acquired RF parameters are then read with a monitoring system developed in Labview, which also includes the classification algorithm.

With the mentioned system up and running, the rejection rate was measured and it was verified that less than $40\%$ of the non-conforming devices, due to signal decoding problems, actually presented a defect. As a result, a considerable financial saving was noticed, which made the mentioned production line much more efficient and cost effective.

\section{Conclusion}
This paper proposes a methodology to monitor DTV products rejected due to signal decoding problems, in order to verify if there really is hardware/software problem or a poor signal condition cased the non-conformity. Test results in a real environment showed that the proposed methodology is efficient and effective, when verifying signal conditions during signal decoding tests, and revealed that less than $40\%$ of the observed rejections were really due to non-conforming devices. As future work, state-of-the-art classifiers will be employed, in order to make the proposed methodology more robust ad easily enhanced, through the adoption of other signal parameters.
